[00:14.62] Stone love, she kneels before the grave
[00:19.61] A brave son, who gave his life to save the slogan
[00:28.32] That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
[00:33.89] For they penetrate her grieving
[00:49.39] 
[00:38.57] New love, a boy and girl they talking
[00:44.45] New words that only they can share in
[00:49.94] New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
[00:56.71] To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning
[01:19.71] 
[01:03.25] Love is careless in its choosing
[01:05.81] Sweeping over across a baby
[01:08.98] Love descends on those defenseless
[01:12.47] Idiot love will spark the fusion
[01:28.47] 
[01:15.69] Inspirations have I none
[01:18.74] Just to touch the flaming dove
[01:21.38] All I have is my love of love
[01:25.13] And love is not loving
[01:36.13] 
[01:53.56] Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
[01:59.76] Told of love, and how my God on high is
[02:05.11] All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
[02:13.95] By the blindness that surrounds him
[02:31.45] 
[02:18.35] Love is careless in its choosing
[02:21.33] Sweeping over across a baby
[02:24.68] Love descends on those defenseless
[02:27.84] Idiot love will spark the fusion
[02:43.84] 
[02:31.40] Inspirations have I none
[02:33.93] Just to touch the flaming dove
[02:37.25] All I have is my love of love
[02:40.68] And love is not loving
[02:51.68] 
[02:47.46] (Love, love)
[02:58.94] (Love, soul love, soul love)
[03:08.93] Lai, lai, la-la la-la la-la, la lai
[03:17.79] La-lai la-lai la-lai, lai, lai, lai
[03:21.55] La-la la-la la-la la-la-la
[03:29.56] La, la, la-la, la, la-la, la
