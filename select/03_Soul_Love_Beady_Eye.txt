Get up off your knees, my friend
Promise never to pretend
You're the apple of my eye
Spread your wings and learn to fly
All I know is you can be
Everything you want to be
Life is short so don't be shy
Tears of joy is all you find
Soul love, soul love
Come into my world
It's all for you, everything I do
It's all for you
You can never be too sure
What or who's behind your door
Watch the people gather round
The circus has just come to town
All I know is I can be
Everything I want to be
Life is short so don't be shy
Spread your wings and learn to fly
Soul love, soul love
Come into my world
It's all for you, everything I do
It's all for you
Soul love, soul love
Come into my world
It's all for you, everything I do
It's all for you
Soul love, soul love
Come into my world
It's all for you, everything I do
It's all for you
It's all for you
All for you
It's all for you
