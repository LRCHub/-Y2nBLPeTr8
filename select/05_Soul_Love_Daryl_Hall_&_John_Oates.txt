I can believe that you love me
The way you set this soul on fife
Typical talk in the daytime
At Nite - only hot desire
I can do anything, darling
'Cause you take me as I am
Baby there's something about us
That makes it a perfect blend
Yeah I found out what love means to me

Gimme that gimme that nasty touch
I dig it so much
Gimme that gimme that nasty touch
We got it - Soul Love
I'm like you & you're like me
So What
We got it, Soul Love
Gimme that gimme that nasty touch
Soul Love

How could it be that we're so tight
Love telepathy
Somebody else could excite me
But what you do - that's another thing
Promise I will do you right
'Cause you've got what I need
I feel you burning inside me
I'm livin' in your love dream
Yeah I know you & I were born to be

So hot Soul Love
So much Soul Love
