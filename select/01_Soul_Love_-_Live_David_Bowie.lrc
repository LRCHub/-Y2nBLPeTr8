[00:13.85] Stone love, she kneels before the grave
[00:19.34] A brave son, who gave his life to see the slogan
[00:27.72] That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
[00:33.63] For they penetrate her grieving
[00:49.13] 
[00:38.06] New love, a boy and girl they talking
[00:44.05] New words, that only they can share in
[00:50.06] New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
[00:56.40] To sleep, through the fleeting hours of morning
[01:19.90] 
[01:00.97] Love is careless in its choosing
[01:05.70] Sweeping over cross a baby
[01:08.70] Love descends on those defenseless
[01:12.57] Idiot love will spark the fusion
[01:28.57] 
[01:15.78] Inspirations have I none
[01:18.58] Just to touch the flaming dove
[01:20.42] All I have is my love of love
[01:25.42] And love is not loving
[01:36.42] 
[01:53.97] Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
[01:59.37] Told of love, and how my God on high is
[02:05.35] All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
[02:13.96] By the blindness that surrounds him
[02:31.46] 
[02:18.61] Love is careless in its choosing
[02:21.37] Sweeping over cross a baby
[02:24.68] Love descends on those defenseless
[02:28.07] Idiot love will spark the fusion
[02:44.07] 
[02:31.75] Inspirations have I none
[02:34.04] Just to touch the flaming dove
[02:37.74] All I have is my love of love
[02:41.00] And love is not loving
[02:52.00] 
[03:10.79] Lai, lai, la-la, la-la la-la, la lai lai
[03:15.44] La-lai la-lai la-lai, lai, lai, lai
[03:20.80] La-la la-la la-la la-la-la
[03:26.53] La, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la
